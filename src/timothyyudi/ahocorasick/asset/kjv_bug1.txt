And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges
   over Israel.

   ^2Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second,
   Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

   ^3And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
   and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

   ^4Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came
   to Samuel unto Ramah,

   ^5And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy
   ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

   ^6But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
   judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people
   in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but
   they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

   ^8According to all the works which they have done since the day that I
   brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have
   forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

   ^9Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly
   unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over
   them.

   ^10And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked
   of him a king.
